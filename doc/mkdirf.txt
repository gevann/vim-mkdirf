INTRODUCTION                                    *mkdirf*

This plugin provides a fuzzy-finder way to create a new file, including any
necessary directories, from within vim. If the file already exists, it opens
that file in the specified buffer, otherwise it creates the file and opens it
for editing.

Emkdirf          Open or create the specified file in the current buffer.

*Smkdirf*
Smkdirf          Open or create the specified file a new split buffer.

*Vmkdirf*
Vmkdirf          Open or create the specified file a new vertically-split buffer.

*<leader>ne*
<leader>ne       Open or create the specified file in the current buffer.

*<leader>ns*
<leader>ns       Open or create the specified file a new split buffer.

*<leader>nv*
<leader>nv       Open or create the specified file a new vertically-split buffer.
